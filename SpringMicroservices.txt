Microservices solves following problem in Monolith,
	Scalability
	Modularity (independently deploying one module i.e service)

Due to because of scalability, modularity issues in Monolith, we moved to MS, but MS has its own set of problems which is generic compared to specific problem in Monolith.

MS - MS is complex, as told in abv point it is generic problems,
	Patterns - Make MS work well together.
	Technologies - Libraries and framework to solve common problems.
	
Difference between MS and Web service.

Best practice , API should not return List<>, If return is Object , then API owner can add a new value in Object, but if API returning List<> then cannot dot this.
