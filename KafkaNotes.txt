Apache Kafka Ecosystem:
	kafka Broker
	Kafka Client API
	Kafka Connect
	kafka Streams
	KSQL
	
Apache Kafka Core Concepts:
	Producer
	Consumer
	Broker
	Cluster
	Topic
	Partitions
	Offset
	Consumer Groups
	
Topic partition is the tool for scalability
Maximum possible parallel consumer is limited by no.of partitions in the topic.
kafka does not allow more than one consumer to read from same partition simultaneously.

What is Kafka Connect ?
	Instead of writing a Kafka client to read from DB and push to Kafka, Kafka connect is used.
	Source >> Kafka connect (source connector) >> Kafka Broker >> Kafka connect (sink connector) >> Target
	Source/Target : Relational DB's, Teradata, IoT Hubs, Salesforce, Twitter, Reddit, File system, cloud storage, hadoop storage, Elastic search, cassandra, MongoDB, google firebase.
